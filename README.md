# Zadaca-br.4_8085

It is designed to regulate crowding in a service facility a system where a counter worker by pressing a button announces its availability, and displays its nature is irrelevant, the number of the counter and the number of the user whose turn it is. There are two counters in the establishment. Users receive numbers upon entry and within one day no more than 255 users. To draw minimally hardware connection and to write a suitable assembly program based on ÂµP 8085A.

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:

1. Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open Emu8086 and load the `palindrome.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
